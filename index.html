    <h2>
      Empathy Is Dying and So Are We
    </h2>
      </div>
    <div class="articletext">
      <p>
        Look up the definition of “human” in the Oxford Dictionary. You'll get “a human being, especially a person as distinguished from an animal or (in science fiction) an alien”.
        This definition does not reveal much about the qualities we humans possess, so let's turn the word into an adjective and define “humane”: “having or showing compassion or benevolence.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of another, is often considered an essential characteristic of humanity, and its absence is often compared to a lack of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there appears to be a decline in human empathy over the years. For example, one psychology study surveyed American university students and reported a 48% decrease in levels of
        empathy between 1979 and 2009. Imagine that: this sample portrayed half the level of empathy they once had 30 years ago. Overall, scientists are reporting a generational decrease in
        empathy and a rise in narcissism around the world, particularly in the West. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, we see an unprecedented and alarming rise in xenophobia, racism, and misogyny around the world that has even generated the concerned attention of the United Nations.
        The Intergovernmental organisation whose purpose is to maintain international peace, security, and friendly relations among nations, must now intervene in relations among people.
        One must wonder: what is going on with the world? The answer is simple after considering the worrying global decline in empathy. Empathy is dying, and we are dying with it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As our empathy decreases, we pay less attention to others around the globe who are suffering, provide less support, and carry on with our lives while millions die.

        <h3>
          Rise of Personal Technology Use
        </h3>
        <br>
      </div>
      <p>
        There is no denying that technology is fantastic. Nevertheless, we need not be repeatedly lectured on the dangers of overuse. In the last decade, there has been an
        increase in social media, phone, and television entertainment. According to Canadian social psychologist Sarah Konrath, spending so much time "interacting with others
        online rather than in reality, interpersonal dynamics such as empathy might certainly be altered." Extensive technology use leads to a decline in empathy not only because of
        the fewer opportunities for empathetic interactions but also because of the immense time it consumes, leaving little room for authentic human connection. Social media, in particular,
        isolates its users by being addictive and constricting them to the platform. Though this effect does not manifest in all social media users, it still occurs threateningly.
        Because social media thrives on people sharing their personal experiences and selves online, people become increasingly concerned with themselves and their portrayals, with little room to sympathise and empathise with others.

          Desensitisation From Negative News
        </h3>
        <br>
      </div>
      <p>
        This past year has been the perfect example of how overwhelming and devastating global news can desensitise viewers. There's no need to look further than
        Rescue.org's Emergency Watchlists to learn about the world's tragic crises. Among the biggest of the latter include the Ukraine War that caused the largest displacement
        crisis in decades (UNHCR), Haiti gang violence, Afghan populations being pushed to poverty, Ethiopian droughts, Somalian hunger, and Myanmar political conflicts.
        Let's not forget Occupied Palestine's new title of "deadliest place for civilians in the world." 
      </p>
      <p>
        My point is evident as I do my research for this article: I am brought close to tears after reading the inconceivable death toll of 18,000 Gazan Palestinians
        (as of December 13th, 2023). That's six times more than the number of people that tragically died during 9/11. Take a moment to process that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, these tragedies come with never-ending news stories, articles, political commentaries, and debates. There is only so much tragedy we can handle as human beings,
        so the constant bombardment with news reports of wars, conflicts, violence, and death leads to desensitisation. In a 2011 study, researchers reported strong desensitisation effects
        only to violent media content. As humans, we innately react to violence with fear. With repeated exposure to violence, the fear reaction decreases in strength due to habituation to the violence.
        In turn, we lose the adverse reactions and become desensitised, meaning we don't respond with anxious arousal in response to media violence.
        Another study found that desensitisation to violence in the news led to reduced emotional reactivity and diminished empathy. When you respond less emotionally,
        it's hard to understand other people's emotions and imagine what they are experiencing.

        <h3>
          Evolving Family Structures
        </h3>
        <br>
      </div>
      <p>
        As previously mentioned, there is a rise in narcissism and entitlement; concern with the self is more prominent than concern for others.
        With that said, changes in family structures are also seen in looser social ties, smaller family units, and more significant time constraints that limit human connection.
        Additionally, with smaller families, children are less likely to learn about and practice empathy-based interactions. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Parenting strategies have also contributed to the decline in empathy. Konrath et al. (2011) speculate that a parenting style characterised by high control and low warmth
      and responsiveness does not effectively teach compassion and empathy in children. Instead, it fosters intolerant and aggressive behaviour with poor emotional expression.
      Interestingly enough, narcissists are those who are most likely to use the aforementioned parenting style. In other words, a rise in narcissism sees a depletion in empathy.

        <h3>
          Final Thoughts
        </h3>
        <br>
      </div>
      <p>
        According to Jennifer Rubin, a writer for the Washington Post, the global lack of empathy has been manifested in "an erosion of civility, decency and compassion in our society,"
        that we can see in political polarisation, "us versus them" thinking styles, hate crimes, and demonising of immigrants and refugees.
        Ultimately, research has established an apparent decline in global levels of empathy. Whether that is due to our technology use, media desensitisation, or the way we were brought up, something has to change. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We cannot sit by and ignore what is happening in other parts of the world simply because we were lucky enough to be born or to exist on the "right" continent.
        We owe it to ourselves and humanity to pay attention to victims of violence, famine, and natural disasters and to offer as much support as possible.
        Regardless of our capabilities to provide financial or material support, we must once again learn, as a civilisation, to empathise.
        We will be met with dire consequences if we continue down this road. It will become more challenging for us to deal with important issues
        like climate change, inequality, displacement, war, famine, and so on. If we don't revive our empathy, this critical human characteristic will
        wither away and die as we sit back and witness the deaths of multiple people across the world.
